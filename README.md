# HOW IT WORKS:

- Download the repo as .zip file
- Extract the .zip file
- Open the Google Chrome and go to "chrome://extensions/"
- On the up-right side of the page, enable the developer mode
- On the up-left side of the page, click load unpacked and select the extracted file
- Voila, you can use the url-tracker extension now :)
